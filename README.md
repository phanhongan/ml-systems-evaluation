# ml-systems-evaluation

A systematic evaluation framework for machine learning systems built on reliability engineering principles.

## Overview

This framework provides a comprehensive approach to evaluating ML systems by applying proven reliability engineering concepts: availability, reliability, maintainability, and safety (ARMS). It helps organizations systematically assess and improve their ML systems' production readiness.

## Key Features

- **Reliability-First Design**: Built on established reliability engineering principles
- **Systematic Evaluation**: Structured approach to ML system assessment
- **Production-Ready Metrics**: Focus on real-world performance indicators
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to adapt for different ML domains
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Built-in support for ongoing system health tracking

## Core Components

### 1. Reliability Metrics
- **Availability**: System uptime and accessibility
- **Reliability**: Consistent performance over time
- **Maintainability**: Ease of updates and debugging
- **Safety**: Error handling and graceful degradation

### 2. Evaluation Dimensions
- **Model Performance**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- **System Performance**: Latency, throughput, resource utilization
- **Data Quality**: Completeness, consistency, freshness
- **Operational Readiness**: Monitoring, alerting, rollback capabilities

### 3. Test Suites
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end system validation
- **Load Tests**: Performance under varying conditions
- **Chaos Tests**: Failure scenario simulation

## Quick Start

```python
from ml_eval import SystemEvaluator, ReliabilityConfig

# Configure evaluation parameters
config = ReliabilityConfig(
    availability_threshold=0.99,
    latency_p95_threshold=500,  # ms
    error_rate_threshold=0.01
)

# Initialize evaluator
evaluator = SystemEvaluator(config)

# Run evaluation
results = evaluator.evaluate_system(model_path, test_data)
print(f"System Reliability Score: {results.overall_score}")
```

## Examples

### Fish Species Classification
