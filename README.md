# ML Systems Evaluation Framework

A reliability-focused evaluation framework for Industrial AI systems, applying Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles to machine learning evaluation.

## The Problem

Industrial AI systems face unique challenges that traditional ML evaluation approaches don't address:

### **Safety-Critical Requirements**
- **Zero Tolerance Failures**: Aircraft landing systems, medical diagnostics, autonomous vehicles where errors can be catastrophic
- **Regulatory Standards**: Aviation (DO-178C), healthcare (FDA), financial services require continuous compliance validation
- **Environmental Constraints**: Underwater devices, extreme temperatures, harsh conditions that affect system reliability

### **Business-Critical Operations**
- **Immediate Financial Impact**: Manufacturing quality control, fraud detection where failures cost millions instantly
- **Real-time Decision Making**: Supply chain optimization, trading systems where delays cause cascading failures
- **Public Safety**: Systems where failures affect public safety, requiring continuous monitoring and rapid response

### **Traditional ML Evaluation Gaps**
- **No Safety Validation**: Standard ML evaluation doesn't assess catastrophic failure scenarios
- **Missing Regulatory Compliance**: No built-in validation against industry-specific standards
- **Inadequate Environmental Monitoring**: Doesn't account for harsh operating conditions
- **No Business Impact Metrics**: Technical metrics don't connect to business outcomes

## Why This Framework Matters

### **SRE Principles for Industrial AI**
This framework treats Industrial AI systems as critical infrastructure, applying proven SRE concepts:
- **Safety-First Error Budgets**: Acceptable failure rates with zero tolerance for catastrophic failures
- **Regulatory SLOs**: Service Level Objectives that include compliance requirements
- **Environmental Observability**: Monitoring that accounts for harsh operating conditions
- **Business-Critical Reliability**: Focus on preventing immediate financial and safety impacts
- **Rapid Incident Response**: Structured approach to handling safety-critical and business-critical failures

### **Continuous Evaluation Lifecycle**
Evaluation isn't just a final checkpoint—it's a continuous feedback mechanism that informs every stage of the ML lifecycle:

## Advanced Features

### Safety-Critical Development
This framework enables a new approach to Industrial AI development where safety and compliance are built-in:

```python
# Define safety-critical SLOs before model development
slos = {
    "false_positive_rate": SLOConfig(target=0.0001, error_budget=0.0001, compliance="DO-178C"),
    "response_time": SLOConfig(target=50, error_budget=0.001, safety_critical=True),
    "availability": SLOConfig(target=0.99999, error_budget=0.00001, business_impact="catastrophic")
}

# Continuous evaluation during development
evaluator = EvaluationFramework(slos)
evaluator.add_collector(SafetyCollector())
evaluator.add_evaluator(RegulatoryEvaluator())

# Real-time safety validation during training
while training:
    metrics = evaluator.collect_metrics()
    if not evaluator.meets_safety_slos(metrics):
        # Halt development if safety thresholds are violated
        raise SafetyViolationError("Model violates safety requirements")
```

### Workflow Evaluation
```python
from ml_eval import WorkflowEvaluator

evaluator = WorkflowEvaluator()
evaluator.add_stage("preprocessing", slo_config)
evaluator.add_stage("inference", slo_config)
evaluator.add_stage("postprocessing", slo_config)
result = evaluator.evaluate()
```

### Custom Metrics
```python
from ml_eval.collectors import CustomCollector

class DomainSpecificCollector(CustomCollector):
    def collect(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
        # Custom metric collection logic
        return {"custom_metric": value}
```

### Safety-Critical Continuous Improvement

# Automated safety validation and retraining for Industrial AI
class SafetyCriticalImprovement:
    def __init__(self, evaluation_framework):
        self.framework = evaluation_framework
    
    def check_safety_compliance(self):
        result = self.framework.evaluate()
        
        if result.safety_violation_detected:
            # Immediate system shutdown for safety
            self.emergency_shutdown()
            self.create_safety_incident(result)
            
        if result.regulatory_compliance_violated:

            self.halt_operations()
            self.notify_regulatory_authorities(result)
            
        if result.environmental_conditions_changed:
