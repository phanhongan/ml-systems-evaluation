## Key Concepts

For detailed explanations of key concepts, see the main [README.md](../README.md) in the project root.

### Safety-Critical Systems
Systems where failures can result in loss of life, serious injury, or environmental damage.

### Business-Critical Systems  
Systems where failures can result in significant financial loss or operational disruption.

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
Measurable targets for system reliability, performance, and safety.

### Error Budgets
The acceptable amount of time a system can be unavailable or not meeting SLOs.

### Compliance Standards
Industry-specific regulations and standards that must be met.
