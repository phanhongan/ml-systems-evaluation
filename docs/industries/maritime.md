# 🚢 Maritime Industry Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information for implementing the ML Systems Evaluation Framework in maritime environments, with a focus on collision avoidance, navigational safety, and regulatory compliance.

## 🚢 Maritime Overview

Maritime systems require high levels of safety, reliability, and compliance with international regulations. The framework provides specialized components for maritime-specific needs, including collision avoidance, navigational decision support, and compliance with standards such as COLREGs.

## 🎯 Key Maritime Challenges

### 1. 🚨 Collision Avoidance
- **🔍 Risk Detection**: Identifying potential collision scenarios in real time
- **🚨 Alerting**: Timely and accurate alerts to the Officer of the Watch (OOW)
- **📊 Scenario Classification**: Correctly distinguishing between crossing, head-on, and overtaking situations, considering both STW (Speed Through Water) and SOG (Speed Over Ground)

### 2. 📋 Regulatory Compliance
- **📋 COLREGs**: Adhering to International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea
- **🚢 IMO Guidelines**: Meeting International Maritime Organization safety standards
- **📝 Record Keeping**: Logging compliance-relevant events and actions

### 3. 🧭 Navigation Complexity
- **🌊 Environmental Factors**: Handling fog, storms, and high-traffic conditions
- **📊 Parameter Monitoring**: Tracking TCPA, DCPA, BCR, STW, SOG, and other navigation metrics
- **🔌 Sensor Fusion**: Integrating radar, AIS, and environmental data

## ⚙️ Maritime-Specific Configuration

### 🚢 Maritime Collision Avoidance System Example

See the full template in [`docs/user-guides/templates.md`](../user-guides/templates.md) for a complete, ready-to-use configuration example.

Key configuration highlights:
- **👨‍💼 Persona**: Officer of the Watch (OOW)
- **🚨 Critical SLOs**: Collision avoidance accuracy, alert latency, false alarm rate, system availability
- **🛡️ Safety Parameter**: STW vs SOG discrepancy threshold
- **🧭 Navigation Parameters**: TCPA, DCPA, BCR, STW, SOG
- **📋 Regulatory Compliance**: COLREGs, IMO Guidelines

## 🏆 Maritime Best Practices

### 1. 🚨 Collision Avoidance Best Practices
- 🔌 Use sensor fusion (radar, AIS, environmental) for robust risk detection
- 📊 Monitor both STW and SOG to avoid scenario misclassification
- 🛡️ Set safety thresholds for navigation parameter discrepancies
- 🚨 Provide clear, timely alerts to the OOW

### 2. 📋 Regulatory Compliance Best Practices
- 📝 Log all compliance-relevant events and actions
- 🔍 Regularly review system recommendations against COLREGs and IMO guidelines
- 📋 Maintain audit trails for incident investigations

### 3. 🧭 Navigation and Environmental Monitoring
- 📊 Continuously monitor TCPA, DCPA, BCR, and other key parameters
- 🌊 Adapt alerting and recommendations to changing weather and traffic conditions
- 🧪 Test system performance in simulated adverse conditions
