# 🚨 Error Budget Management

This guide provides comprehensive information about error budget management in the ML Systems Evaluation Framework, including definitions, calculation, monitoring, and best practices.

## 🎯 What are Error Budgets?

Error budgets define the acceptable amount of time a system can be unavailable or not meeting Service Level Objectives (SLOs). They help teams make informed decisions about deployments, changes, and risk-taking.

## 📊 Error Budget Concepts

### 📋 Error Budget Definition

An error budget is the inverse of your SLO target. For example:
- If your SLO is 99.9% availability, your error budget is 0.1%
- If your SLO is 95% accuracy, your error budget is 5%

### 🧮 Error Budget Calculation

```python
# Error budget calculation
# Always inferred from SLO target
error_budget = 1 - slo_target
```

## ⚙️ Error Budget Configuration

> **Note:** You do not specify error_budget in your configuration. It is always inferred from the SLO target.

### 🔧 Example SLO Configuration

```yaml
slos:
  availability:
    target: 0.9999
    window: "30d"
    description: "System availability"
  accuracy:
    target: 0.95
    window: "30d"
    description: "Model accuracy"
```

## 📊 Error Budget Monitoring

The framework automatically tracks error budget consumption, burn rate, and remaining budget for each SLO based on the target value.

### 🚨 Error Budget Alerts

You can configure alerts based on error budget consumption, burn rate, or remaining budget, but you do not specify error_budget in SLO config.

## 🎯 Error Budget Management Strategies

- **Conservative**: Deploy only if a large portion of the error budget remains.
- **Aggressive**: Deploy with a smaller remaining error budget for faster iteration.
- **Balanced**: Balance stability and innovation based on error budget consumption.

## 🏭 Error Budget by Industry

Error budgets are always calculated as 1.0 - target for each SLO, regardless of industry.

## Error Budget Reporting

The framework provides dashboards and reports showing error budget consumption, burn rate, and remaining budget for each SLO.

## Error Budget Best Practices

- Set realistic SLO targets based on historical performance
- Monitor error budget consumption and burn rate
- Use error budget status to inform deployment and risk decisions
- Communicate error budget status to stakeholders
- Automate alerting and reporting based on error budget status

## Error Budget Examples

```yaml
slos:
  availability:
    target: 0.999
    window: "30d"
    description: "System availability"
  accuracy:
    target: 0.95
    window: "30d"
    description: "Model accuracy"
```

> The error budget for each SLO is always calculated as 1.0 - target (e.g., 0.001 for 99.9% availability).
