# Incident Response Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information about incident response procedures for the ML Systems Evaluation Framework, covering both safety-critical and business-critical incidents.

## Incident Response Overview

The framework provides comprehensive incident response capabilities to handle various types of incidents, from minor performance issues to critical safety events.

## Incident Classification

### Incident Severity Levels

#### Level 1: Informational
- **Description**: Minor issues that don't affect system operation
- **Impact**: Minimal or no impact on users or business
- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours
- **Examples**: Minor performance degradation, non-critical alerts

#### Level 2: Warning
- **Description**: Issues that may affect system performance
- **Impact**: Some impact on users or business processes
- **Response Time**: Within 4 hours
- **Examples**: Performance degradation, increased error rates

#### Level 3: Critical
- **Description**: Issues that significantly affect system operation
- **Impact**: Significant impact on users or business processes
- **Response Time**: Within 1 hour
- **Examples**: System outages, data loss, security breaches

#### Level 4: Emergency
- **Description**: Critical issues that may cause safety or business failure
- **Impact**: Severe impact on safety or business operations
- **Response Time**: Immediate (within 15 minutes)
- **Examples**: Safety-critical system failures, data breaches, regulatory violations
