# Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive testing strategies and best practices for the ML Systems Evaluation Framework, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

## Testing Strategy

The framework follows a multi-layered testing approach to ensure reliability, performance, and correctness.

### Testing Pyramid

```

                ┌─────────────┐
                │   (Few)     │
                └─────────────┘
            Integration Tests
        ┌─────────────────────┐
        │     (Some)          │
        └─────────────────────┘
            Unit Tests

```

## Unit Testing

### Overview

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. Each component should have comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality.

For real test implementations and examples, see the [`/tests`](../tests/) directory in the project.

### Test Structure

See [`/tests`](../tests/) for actual test class and function implementations.

### Test Configuration

Test fixtures and configuration examples are available in [`/tests/conftest.py`](../tests/conftest.py) and related files.

### Testing Custom Components

Refer to [`/tests`](../tests/) for examples of testing custom collectors, evaluators, and other components.

## Integration Testing

### Overview

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly and that the overall system functions as expected.

See [`/tests`](../tests/) for integration test implementations.

### Test Structure

Integration test classes and workflows are implemented in [`/tests`](../tests/).

### Database Integration Testing

Database integration tests: **To be implemented.**

## End-to-End Testing

### Overview

End-to-end tests verify that the complete system works correctly from start to finish, including all components and external dependencies.

See [`/tests`](../tests/) for end-to-end test implementations.

### Test Structure

End-to-end test classes and CLI/API integration tests are implemented in [`/tests`](../tests/).

## Performance Testing

### Overview

Performance tests verify that the system meets performance requirements under various load conditions.

See [`/tests`](../tests/) for performance test implementations.

### Test Structure

Performance test classes and concurrent evaluation tests are implemented in [`/tests`](../tests/).

## Security Testing

### Overview

Security tests verify that the system handles sensitive data appropriately and is protected against common security vulnerabilities.

See [`/tests`](../tests/) for security test implementations.

### Test Structure

Security test classes and input validation tests are implemented in [`/tests`](../tests/).

## Test Automation

### CI/CD Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and automated testing. For the latest CI/CD workflow configuration, refer to the workflow file at:

[.github/workflows/test.yml](../.github/workflows/test.yml)

This workflow runs tests, checks coverage, and uploads results automatically on every push and pull request.

### Test Configuration

Test configuration is managed in [`pytest.ini`](../pytest.ini) and related files in the project root.

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Organization
- Organize tests by component and type
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests in classes
- Use fixtures for common setup

### 2. Test Data Management
- Use realistic test data
- Create reusable test fixtures
- Clean up test data after tests
- Use separate test databases

### 3. Mocking and Stubbing
- Mock external dependencies
- Use realistic mock responses
- Test error conditions
- Verify mock interactions

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Run performance tests regularly
- Monitor test execution time
- Use appropriate test data sizes
- Test under realistic conditions

### 5. Security Testing
- Test input validation
- Verify authentication
- Check data encryption
- Test access controls

### 6. Continuous Testing
- Automate test execution
- Integrate with CI/CD
- Monitor test coverage
- Track test metrics

This testing guide provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the reliability and quality of the ML Systems Evaluation Framework through thorough testing at all levels.
