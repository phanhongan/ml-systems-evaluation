```

## Industry-Specific Considerations

### Manufacturing
- Focus on quality control metrics
- Include defect detection rates
- Monitor production efficiency
- Track cost implications

### Aviation
- Emphasize safety-critical metrics

- Include efficiency metrics
- Track cost optimization

## Best Practices

1. **Start with a Template**: Use industry-specific templates as starting points
2. **Customize Gradually**: Modify templates incrementally
3. **Validate Configuration**: Test configurations before production use
4. **Document Changes**: Keep track of customizations
5. **Review Regularly**: Update templates based on system evolution

## Template Validation

```bash
# Validate a template
ml-eval templates validate manufacturing-basic

# Test a template with sample data
ml-eval templates test manufacturing-basic --sample-data
```
