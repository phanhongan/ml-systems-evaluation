# Aquaculture Industry Examples

This directory contains examples for aquaculture and aquatic resource management ML systems with a focus on sonar classification, species identification, and environmental monitoring.

## Examples

### fish-species-classification.yaml
An example of commercial fishing sonar classification that demonstrates:

- **Sonar signal processing**: Real-time fish detection from sonar signals
- **Species classification**: Accurate fish species identification for catch management
- **Environmental hazard detection**: Identification and avoidance of environmental hazards including ghost gear
- **Bycatch prevention**: Protected species identification and avoidance
- **Regulatory compliance**: Fishery management and marine conservation standards

## Usage

1. Review the configuration to understand fishing-specific requirements
2. Adapt sonar parameters to your vessel's equipment
3. Customize target species and fishing methods
4. Integrate with your existing vessel systems and regulatory reporting

## Industry-Specific Considerations

- **Fishing environments**: Coastal, offshore, estuarine, continental shelf waters
- **Weather conditions**: Calm seas, moderate swell, rough seas, storm conditions
- **Water parameters**: Depth, temperature, salinity, turbidity, current speeds
- **Fishing methods**: Gill net, buoy net, and other commercial fishing techniques
- **Target species**: Cod, haddock, salmon, tuna, mackerel, and other commercial species
- **Environmental monitoring**: Integration with environmental hazard detection systems

## Future Examples

This category can be extended to include:
- **Aquaculture farming**: Fish farming and shellfish cultivation systems
- **Marine resource management**: Sustainable fishing and resource monitoring
- **Environmental impact assessment**: Ecosystem health and biodiversity monitoring
