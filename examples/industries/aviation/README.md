# Aviation Industry Examples

This directory contains examples for aviation-related ML systems with a focus on safety-critical applications.

## Examples

### aircraft-landing.yaml
A comprehensive example of a safety-critical aircraft landing system that demonstrates:

- **High reliability requirements**: 99.99% accuracy targets for critical functions
- **Safety thresholds**: Strict limits on false positive rates and response times
- **Regulatory compliance**: FAA, EASA, and ICAO standards
- **Real-time monitoring**: Sub-second response times for critical decisions
- **Environmental factors**: Weather conditions, runway types, traffic density

## Usage

1. Review the configuration to understand aviation-specific requirements
2. Adapt SLOs and thresholds to your specific aircraft type
3. Customize environmental conditions and operating parameters
4. Integrate with your existing flight systems and regulatory reporting

## Industry-Specific Considerations

- **Safety margins**: Built-in safety margins for critical decisions
- **Redundancy**: Multiple evaluation paths for critical functions
- **Regulatory reporting**: Automated compliance reporting for aviation authorities
- **Environmental factors**: Weather, traffic, and runway condition monitoring
