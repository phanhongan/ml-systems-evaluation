# Manufacturing Industry Examples

This directory contains examples for manufacturing-related ML systems with a focus on predictive maintenance and demand forecasting.

## Examples

### predictive-maintenance.yaml
An example of industrial equipment predictive maintenance that demonstrates:

- **VAE anomaly detection**: Variational Autoencoder for equipment failure prediction
- **Rule-based fault detection**: Expert rules for immediate fault identification
- **Ensemble predictions**: Combined VAE and rule-based approaches
- **Cost optimization**: Maintenance cost and downtime reduction tracking
- **Regulatory compliance**: ISO standards for vibration and temperature monitoring

### product-demand-forecasting.yaml
A manufacturing demand forecasting system that demonstrates:

- **Business metrics**: Revenue, cost, and efficiency tracking
- **Production optimization**: Capacity planning and resource allocation
- **Supply chain integration**: Inventory and supplier management
- **Market analysis**: Demand patterns and seasonal variations

## Usage

1. Review the configuration to understand manufacturing-specific requirements
2. Adapt equipment types and maintenance parameters to your facility
3. Customize cost metrics and regulatory standards
4. Integrate with your existing SCADA and MES systems

## Industry-Specific Considerations

- **Equipment diversity**: Support for pumps, motors, compressors, conveyors, valves
- **Environmental factors**: Temperature, humidity, and dust monitoring
- **Maintenance windows**: Planned vs. unplanned maintenance optimization
- **Cost tracking**: Equipment lifetime and replacement cost analysis
- **Safety compliance**: Vibration and temperature limit monitoring
