# Maritime Industry Examples

This directory contains examples for maritime-related ML systems with a focus on collision avoidance and navigation safety.

## Examples

### collision-avoidance.yaml
An example of a maritime collision avoidance system that demonstrates:

- **Real-time safety monitoring**: Continuous vessel tracking and collision prediction
- **Vessel classification**: Accurate identification of different vessel types
- **Distance estimation**: Precise calculation of vessel proximity
- **Safety alerts**: Critical collision warnings with low latency
- **Regulatory compliance**: COLREGs and IMO guidelines integration

## Usage

1. Review the configuration to understand maritime-specific requirements
2. Adapt vessel types and traffic density parameters to your operating area
3. Customize weather conditions and navigation parameters
4. Integrate with your existing bridge systems and AIS receivers

## Industry-Specific Considerations

- **COLREGs compliance**: International collision regulations integration
- **Weather impact**: Adverse weather condition handling
- **Traffic density**: High-traffic area considerations
- **Vessel-specific parameters**: Different vessel type characteristics
- **Emergency protocols**: Critical situation response procedures
